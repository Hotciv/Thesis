# an anytime system that builds decision trees using constant memory and
# constant time per example. Introduced in 2000 by Pedro Domingos and Geoff Hulten,
# it makes use of a well known statistical result, the Hoeffding bound,
# in order to guarantee that its output is asymptotically identical to
# that of a traditional learner.
